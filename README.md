# Next.JS Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with Next.JS and TailwindCSS. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key to it.
Note: You can get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). Also, this app uses the One Call API, so make sure you enable it in your API key settings.

```bash
API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
